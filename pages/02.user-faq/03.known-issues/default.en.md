##### **Server list response has expired! Set correct time and timezone on your PC**
DST (Daylight Savings) causes the issue, change your timezone by 1 hour forward or behind to fix it.


#### **"Publisher/ASN ban or Spoofer Detected"**

##### **Game started but not loading!!!**
Just wait for the game to launch, This is a known issue with the AC. If you have a SSD we suggest that you install the game on that.


#### **My game is refusing to launch, but I meet the minimum requirements**
 * Solution 1. Check if you have a folder named SCP Secret Laboratory in your Roaming folder, You can access this by hitting Windows Key + r and typing in %appdata%. If it is not there, create a folder named SCP Secret Laboratory and launch the game again.
 * Solution 2. If that does not work and install [this](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
