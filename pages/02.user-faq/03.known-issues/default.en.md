# **User FAQ | Known Issues**


### **1. Server list response has expired! Set correct time and timezone on your PC.**

DST (Daylight Savings) causes the issue, change your timezone by 1 hour forward or behind to fix it.

### **2. I have -1 hp or other issues while playing on a nondedicated server!**

Don't use it, the function is broken in Stable and Beta. 

### **3. Some settings are not saving or they're not working**

It is a known bug, there's nothing you can do. Just ignore the fact and wait for the updates.


### **4. Server round is not restarting/loading and it stuck on 0%**

Solution 1. (If your the server owner) Inside of your config_gameplay file set the line <kbd>idle_mode_enabled</kbd> to false.

Solution 2. (If your not the server owner) Either find another server to play on or tell the server owner of that server to fix it.
 
### **5. 0x0000 Windows Error**

Solution 1. Use "RESET ALL SETTINGS" launch option or set your Graphics API to DX11 and use default menu.

### **6. Game keeps crashing on Windows 7**

The game is broken on Windows 7 and most likely Northwood will drop support for it soon, You need to upgrade to Windows 10 and either way why would you still be on Windows 7 when its security is bad.

### **7. The game does not work on Linux**

The game is **not** supported on Linux.

### **8. Game does not start, Just shows logo.**

Solution 1. Most likely SCP:SL was not able to create a <kbd>appdata</kbd> folder, Simply go to <kbd>\AppData\Roaming\</kbd> and make a folder called <kbd>SCP Secret Laboratory</kbd> and start the game back up.
