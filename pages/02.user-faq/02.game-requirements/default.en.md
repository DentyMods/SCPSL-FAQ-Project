# **User FAQ | Game Requirements**

### Minimum Requirements Notice

> "But, I was able to play before so how is it possible that my issue is made by my current specification? I can play GTA V on 30 FPS, why are you telling me my game has issues due to my specs!!1!!!!1!???"</cite>

Well, SL is different. Do not blame anyone for that, devs are trying their best to optimize the game. Your only hope is new CPU/GPU/RAM etc. or rare, but still possible - optimization in next update

! Remember that even if you pass minimum requirements, there's always a chance your game might not run smoothly or launch.
