# **User FAQ | Public Beta**


## How to play the beta

### Steam

Open Steam and navigate to "Library" at the top left and click home, Then find "SCP: Secret Laboratory" and right-click the game and open "Properties..." then click "Betas" and choose "publicbeta - 11.0.0".

- If you want to switch back to stable version choose "none" in Betas


### Discord

You must be in the official SCP:SL Discord server, Go to the top of the server and select "SCP : SL Public B" and add it to your Discord library, After it is added we suggest that you restart Discord since Discord acts up when you add a game to your library, After restarting navigate to your Home page and click "Library" near the top left and click "Install" next to "SCP: Secrect Laboratory (public-beta). Images are below if you are having an issue.
